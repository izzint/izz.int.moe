### a website,
i wanted to say before the big block of text below is that i'm really trying my hardest with
a website like this. i prefer this type of writing compared to having like a private account
on social media or just messaging someone over discord. it really feels like i can put my heart and
love into making a website truly reflect upon me, and the way i like to express myself. this is the 5th version of a website i've been making for a long time, it's something that changes with me, and **it's something i like changing.**

### i'm late to this but; HAPPY NEW YEAR! 
i've been wanting to get better at talking about my feelings to people, and just beable to jot 
down a few thoughts for all the world to see. i'm still trying to figure out how to express some thoughts
on paper, and learning how to write better generally 

### i've been meaning to ask my parents for medication 
to handle my anxiety but my mom insists that i shouldn't, i do get where she's coming from with that though; i've tried a couple of medications for ADHD in the past (namely Strattera and Adderal) they didn't behave the best in me and i mostly had to walk through puddles of side effects to even any do anything in my life. (i wish i didnt need that stuff to function)

### during the summer, 
i mostly just isolated myself
from the world, and spent most of my time making stuff like this.
making stuff like this is fun though... sooo was that a good thing??? maybe.. 

### it's winter now though, 
it's cold with not that much sunlight (i'm starting to get more hours of it though)
christmas for me didn't really feel like christmas and i didn't really do anything over the break, but 
i usually dont. i was meaning to get together with a couple of friends for new years eve, but i don't
think i really have anyone close enough to me to do that :p.. i guess you could say one of my resolutions
for 2025 is to just, be more kind of a person, try and find more people like me that enjoy talking to me and stop making all of my friendships centered around me making stuff for them. 

### school's back,
i think i've been sleepwalking through my classes (when am i not doing that in life) most of the time and am spending my last one right now writing this instead of the cover letter im supposed to turn into my carrers teacher by the end of next week (sorry :[) i'm looking to get this out before the day ends so, 

izz
